title: Code re-writing
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The code for generating the object type indexes has to be re-worked and re-written from Octave to JS for Node.js and TW. As a good starting pattern for this an elegant JS plugin titled [[autoref.js|http://autoref.tiddlyspot.com/#%24%3A%2FMAS%2Freference%2Fautoref.js]] by author [[Mark S.|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/z7iotkgKQHw/5QrTAkLXDQAJ]] can be considered.

It would be great if somebody from the TW community would complete the development of this code based on the mentioned and other working-outs:

* [[autoref.js|http://autoref.tiddlyspot.com/#%24%3A%2FMAS%2Freference%2Fautoref.js]] by Mark S.;
