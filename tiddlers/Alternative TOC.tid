title: Alternative TOC
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The current "classical" [[TOC macros|https://tiddlywiki.com/#%24%3A%2Fcore%2Fmacros%2Ftoc]] seems a bit awkward for building the TOC index (see [[Generating the TOC index]]). Instead, the drag-and-drop mechanism recently extended for lists (see  [[list-links-draggable macro|https://tiddlywiki.com/#list-links-draggable%20Macro]]) looks much more suitable for hierarchical TOC interactive building and therefore could be used for ''TOC index'' building with much more ease.

It would be great if somebody from the TW community would challenge the development of this alternative TOC tool.
